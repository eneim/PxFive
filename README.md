## :scroll: Description
Building the beautiful garden design guide application using Jetpack Compose.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
This is one of the most complex Compose App I have ever played with. It is a lot of fun. I realize that
some of the spec in the Bloom.pdf doesn't match correctly. For example the the "Beautiful home garden solutions" is said to have 32dp from its
baseline to top, but due to the keylines, it is 24dp.

So tuning the result to meet the expectation is something takes the most of my time, which is also
the part I feel satisfied the most. It is easier working with design using Compose than the traditional
XML base configuration.
